# Advent of Code 2020

An attempt to solve each of the adventofcode.com 2020 puzzles in Python as they're released. I'm also challenging myself to not use any libraries (even the standard library) for the "core" part of the algorithm problem. I will still use things like the builtins to read from files, do simple string manipulation, etc, as long as it doesn't assist in the _main_ algorithm challenge.

If the code's here, that means the solution _works_, not necessarily that it's optimal, although optimization is still a goal.

Each solution can be run standalone, without dependencies, with python 3.6+.
