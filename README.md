# Advent of Code 2020

An attempt to solve each of the adventofcode.com 2020 puzzles in Python as they're released. The solutions carry the additional self-imposed restriction of not using any `import`s (with the exception of assistance to read each problem's input file).

If the code's here, that means the solution _works_, not necessarily that it's optimal, although optimization is still a goal.

Each solution can be run standalone, without dependencies, with python 3.6+.
